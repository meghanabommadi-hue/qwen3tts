"""Pipeline position: SYNTHESIS SERVICE — singleton wrapper around the model.

Role in pipeline:
  Provides a process-wide singleton (synthesis_service) that both the
  worker (worker.py) and the single-process server (server.py) call via:

      audio_tokens = await synthesis_service.synthesize(text)

  Ensures the sglang Engine and ncodec TTSCodec are loaded exactly once per
  process, no matter how many concurrent requests arrive.

Lazy initialisation:
  initialize() is called on first use (worker._process_job) or at server
  startup (server._get_synthesizer). Subsequent calls are no-ops.
